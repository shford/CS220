PEX1 Summary of Important Changes:

1) Add header file via #include "WordCloud.h" to file PEX1.c
Line: 34

2) Created and initialized int wordCount to 0 at beginning of CountWordsInFile(char* argFileName)
Line: 43

3) Changed condition in if statement to if (filePtr != NULL) from if (filePtr)
Line: 50

4) Changed the 2nd fscan() argument from "%"MAX_WORD_LENGTH_STRING"s" to "%s"
Line: 55

5) Not an error fix, but I deleted the #define STRING char* in PEX.h and replaced all usages of STRING with char* in PEX.c
Line: N/A

6) Not an error fix, but I deleted #define MAX_WORD_LENGTH_STRING "5" from file PEX.h

7) In function int NumUniqueWords(WordCount* argWordCount), inside the while loop, changed i = 1; to i += 1
Line: 138

8) In function WordCount* CreateWordCountArray(int argNumberofWords), I changed malloc() argument to 
(argNumberofWords+1)*sizeof(WordCount) from (argNumberofWords+1)*sizeof(int)
Line: 156

9) In function WordCount* ReadExclusionFile(char* argFileName), I changed int numWords = CountWordsInFile(argFileName); to int numWords = CountWordsInFile(argFileName) + 1;
Line: 175

10) Changed if (!filePtr) to if (filePrt == NULL)
Line: 189

11) Changed while (fscanf(filePtr, "%"MAX_WORD_LENGTH_STRING"s", charBuffer) == 1) to while (fscanf(filePtr, "%s", charBuffer) == 1)
Line: 201

12) Changed while (fscanf(filePtr, "%"MAX_WORD_LENGTH_STRING"s", charBuffer) == 1) to while (fscanf(filePtr, "%s ", charBuffer) == 1)
Line: 248

13) In function bool WordExistsInWordCount(WordCount* argWordCount, STRING argBuffer), added return false; to end of function
Line: 281

14) In void UpdateWordCount(WordCount* argWordCount, char* argBuffer), and after several hours, changed argWordCount[i].word = argBuffer; to strcpy(argWordCount[i].word, argBuffer);
Line: 302

15) In function int main(int argc, char* argv), changed if (argc <= 1) to if (argc < 4) to force users to enter the proper number of parameters
Line: 389

16) In file WordCloud.h, added #pragma once to top and added #include <stdio.h>
Line: 8, 10

17) Deleted #include <stdio.h> from WordCloud.c to clean up the file and prevent include problems

18) In file WordCloud.c, replaced all uses of STRING with char*

19) In int BuildWordCloud(WordCount* argWordCount, char* argFileName, int argNumWords), changed filePtr = fopen(argFileName, "a"); to filePtr = fopen(argFileName, "w+");
Line: 24

20) Changed if (argWordCount[i].count = 1) to if (argWordCount[i].count == 1)
Line: 36

21) Changed all occurences of STRING to char* in file PEX1.h

22) Increased MAX_WORD_LENGTH from 5 to 40 to file PEX1.h
Line: 9

23) Added #define MAX_EXCLUDE_SIZE 500 to file PEX1.h
Line: 10

24) Changed typedef struct to typedef struct WordCount_type
Line: 11
